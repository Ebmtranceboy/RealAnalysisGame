Introduction "# Problem 1

Prove the same theorem as `BddOfConvNonzero`, but without the assumption that `L ≠ 0`. (Hint: break
the proof into cases, and the case `L ≠ 0` should just be an appeal to `BddOfConvNonzero`. What
do you do in the other case?)

Statement BddOfConv (a : ℕ → ℝ) (L : ℝ) (ha : SeqLim a L) :
    SeqBdd a := by
by_cases hL : L = 0
rewrite [hL] at ha
choose N hN using ha 1 (by norm_num)
have f1 : 0 ≤ ∑ k ∈ range N, |a k| := by apply sum_nonneg (by bound)
use 1 + ∑ k ∈ range N, |a k|
