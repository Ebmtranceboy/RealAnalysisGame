# Problem Set 15: Solve these problems in Natural Language:

$\\# 1)$ Let $a_0 := \\sqrt2$, and $a_{n+1}:=\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{a_n}}$. Prove that $a_n < 2$ holds for all $n$, and that $a_n$ converges.

$\\# 2)$ Calculate $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(\\sqrt{n^2+n}-n\\right)$ rigorously.

$\\# 3)$ Show that if a sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` is convergent,
 then the \"Cesaro-average\" sequence given by:

 `b n = (a 0 + a 1 + ... + a (n-1)) / n`

converges, and to the same limit. Give an example of a sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` which
does *not* converge, but for which the Cesaro average sequence does converge.
