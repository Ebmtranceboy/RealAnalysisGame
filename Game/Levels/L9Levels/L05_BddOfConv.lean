# Level 2: Bounded

Welcome to one of the most fundamental results in real analysis: **convergent sequences are bounded**! This theorem tells us that if a sequence converges to a limit, it can't wander off to infinity‚Äîit must stay within some finite region.

## The Goal

Prove that if `a : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñù` converges to a nonzero limit `L`, then `a` is bounded (i.e., there exists some `M > 0` such that `|a n| ‚â§ M` for all `n`).

**Note:** The case `L = 0` will be handled in the exercises. For now, we focus on nonzero limits.

## The Big Idea

Think about what convergence means: eventually, all terms get close to `L`. So for large `n`, we have `|a n| ‚â§ 2|L|` (approximately).

But what about the **finitely many terms before** the sequence gets close to `L`? That's where your `TermLeSum` theorem from Level 1 comes in! You can bound those initial terms by their finite sum.

### The Strategy:

1. **Eventually bounded:** Use `EventuallyBdd_of_SeqConv` to find an `N` such that `|a n| ‚â§ 2|L|` for all `n ‚â• N`

2. **Initially bounded:** For `n < N`, use `TermLeSum` to show `|a n| ‚â§ ‚àë k ‚àà range N, |a k|`

3. **Global bound:** Combine both parts with:
   ```
   M = 2 * |L| + ‚àë k ‚àà range N, |a k|
   ```

   This works because:
   - For `n ‚â• N`: the term `|a n|` is covered by `2|L|`
   - For `n < N`: the term `|a n|` is covered by the sum

4. **Prove `M > 0`:** Show that your bound is positive (needed for the definition of `SeqBdd`)

5. **Prove `‚àÄ n, |a n| ‚â§ M`:** Split into cases based on whether `n ‚â• N` or `n < N`

## New Tools You'll Need

### `SeqBdd`
Definition: A sequence `a : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñù` is **bounded** if `‚àÉ M > 0, ‚àÄ n, |a n| ‚â§ M`

## Your Mission

Construct the bound `M`, prove it's positive, then verify it works for all terms by splitting into the two cases. Let your `TermLeSum` theorem shine!

Good luck! üöÄ

Conclusion "
# üéâ Outstanding Achievement!

You've just proven one of the **cornerstone theorems of real analysis**: convergent sequences with nonzero limits are bounded! This is a result you'll use again and again throughout your journey in analysis.

## What You Accomplished

You proved that convergence implies boundedness:
```
SeqLim a L ‚Üí L ‚â† 0 ‚Üí SeqBdd a
```

This tells us something profound: **convergent sequences can't escape to infinity**. They must remain trapped in a finite region of the real line.

### Key Techniques You Mastered:

1. **Two-region strategy** - You split the natural numbers into two parts:
   - Eventually (n ‚â• N): where convergence gives you control
   - Initially (n < N): where you used your TermLtSum theorem

2. **Constructing clever bounds** - You built `M = 2*|L| + ‚àë k ‚àà range N, |a k|`, which elegantly captures both regions in a single expression

3. **Case analysis** - You used `by_cases` to handle the two regions separately, applying the appropriate bound for each

4. **Connecting theorems** - You saw how `TermLtSum` from Level 1 became an essential tool for handling finitely many terms

## Why This Matters

The boundedness of convergent sequences is fundamental throughout mathematics:

- **Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem**: Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence (you've proven half of this!)
- **Uniform Convergence**: Bounded sequences are essential for proving uniform convergence results
- **Compactness**: This result is key to understanding compactness in metric spaces
- **Practical Analysis**: Knowing a sequence stays bounded helps with error analysis and numerical computations

## The Missing Piece: L = 0

Notice we assumed `L ‚â† 0` in this proof. The case where `L = 0` is left as an exercise, but the idea is similar:
- Use convergence with `Œµ = 1` to bound terms eventually by `1`
- Handle the finitely many initial terms with TermLtSum
- The bound becomes `M = 1 + ‚àë k ‚àà range N, |a k|`

## Looking Ahead

You now understand that convergent sequences live in a bounded world. This prepares you for deeper results:
- Sequences that are bounded but don't converge (like `(-1)^n`)
- The relationship between boundedness, monotonicity, and convergence
- Cauchy sequences and completeness of the reals

Congratulations on mastering this essential theorem! You're building the foundation for advanced analysis. Keep going! üöÄ
