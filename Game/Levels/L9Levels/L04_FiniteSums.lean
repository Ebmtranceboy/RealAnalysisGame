# Level 1: Finite Sums

Welcome to a new world of mathematics: **finite sums**! In this level, you'll prove that any individual term in a sum of absolute values is bounded by the total sum. This is a fundamental property that bridges discrete and continuous mathematics.

## The Goal

Prove that for any sequence `a : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñù` and natural number `N`, every term `|a n|` with `n < N` is at most the sum `‚àë k ‚àà range N, |a k|`.

Intuitively: if you're adding up a bunch of nonnegative numbers, no single number can be bigger than the total!

## Strategy: Induction from the Start!

üéØ **Big Hint:** Even though the goal starts with `‚àÄ n < N`, do **NOT** begin with `intro n hn`. Instead, run **induction on `N`** right from the beginning!

This might feel counterintuitive, but trust the process. Induction gives you the perfect structure to peel off one term at a time using `sum_range_succ`.

### Your Induction Strategy:
- **Base case (`N = 0`):** There are no natural numbers less than 0, so you'll get a `contradiction`
- **Inductive step (`N ‚Üí N + 1`):** Use `sum_range_succ` to write the sum for `N + 1` as the sum for `N` plus the new term `|a N|`
  - Split into cases: Is `n < N` (use inductive hypothesis) or `n = N` (use nonnegativity)?

## New Tools You'll Need

### Summation Notation
`‚àë k ‚àà range N` means sum as `k` goes from `0` to `N - 1` (which has `N` terms total!)

### `sum_range_succ`
Peels off the last term: `‚àë k ‚àà range (N + 1), f k = (‚àë k ‚àà range N, f k) + f N`

### `sum_nonneg`
If each term is nonnegative, so is the sum. Usage: `apply sum_nonneg`, then prove `‚àÄ k ‚àà range N, 0 ‚â§ f k`

### `contradiction`
If your hypotheses are contradictory (like `n : ‚Ñï` with `n < 0`), this tactic closes the goal immediately.

### `by_cases`
Split into cases based on a decidable proposition. Usage: `by_cases h : n < N` creates two goals:
- One where `h : n < N` holds
- One where `h : ¬¨(n < N)` holds

Good luck! Remember: **induction first, then introduce `n`!**
"

/-- If your hypotheses lead to a contradiction, (for example: if one of your hypotheses is that `h : n < 0` where `n : ‚Ñï` is a natural number) then the `contradiction` tactic closes the goal. -/

Conclusion "
# üéâ Excellent Work!

You've just proven a fundamental result about finite sums! This theorem might seem simple, but it's a powerful building block that appears throughout analysis.

## What You Accomplished

You successfully proved that **every term is bounded by the total sum**:
```
‚àÄ n < N, |a n| ‚â§ ‚àë k ‚àà range N, |a k|
```

### Key Techniques You Mastered:

1. **Strategic induction** - You learned to use induction on `N` *before* introducing the universal quantifier, which made the proof structure much cleaner

2. **Working with finite sums** - You used `sum_range_succ` to peel off terms and `sum_nonneg` to establish nonnegativity

3. **Case analysis** - You split the proof into two cases (`n < N` vs `n = N`) and handled each appropriately

4. **Combining results** - You cleverly used the inductive hypothesis for earlier terms and nonnegativity for the final term

## Why This Matters

This result is essential for the next level! You'll use `TermLeSum` to prove that **convergent sequences are bounded**. Here's the connection:

- Every convergent sequence is eventually close to its limit
- But what about the finitely many terms *before* it gets close?
- That's where your theorem comes in! You can bound those initial terms by their finite sum
- Combine this with the eventual bound, and you get a global bound for the entire sequence

## Looking Ahead

In the next level, you'll prove `BddOfConvNonzero`: convergent sequences with nonzero limits are bounded. This is a cornerstone result in analysis that tells us convergent sequences can't escape to infinity.
