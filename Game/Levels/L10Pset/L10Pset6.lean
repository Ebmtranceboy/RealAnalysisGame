Statement (a : ℕ → ℝ) (ha : ∀ n, a n = n) : ¬ SeqBdd a := by
intro h
choose L Lpos hL using h
let N : ℕ := ⌈L⌉₊ + 1
have hN : N = ⌈L⌉₊ + 1 := by rfl
have hN' : (N : ℝ) = ⌈L⌉₊ + 1 := by exact_mod_cast hN
have hL' : L ≤ ⌈L⌉₊ := by bound
have hNL : L < N := by linarith [hL', hN']
specialize hL N
rewrite [ha] at hL
have Npos' : 0 ≤ N := by bound
have Npos : (0 : ℝ) ≤ N := by exact_mod_cast Npos'
rewrite [(by apply abs_of_nonneg Npos : |(N : ℝ)| = N)] at hL
linarith [hL, hNL]

Conclusion "Done."
