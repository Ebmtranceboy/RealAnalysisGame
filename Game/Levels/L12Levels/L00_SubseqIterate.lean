# Level 1: Iterated Subsequence

Let's warm up to the topics of this lecture with a foundational exercise.

Suppose you have a sequence of natural numbers, `σ : ℕ → ℕ`, and all you know about it is that it always exceeds the identity:

`hσ : ∀ n, n < σ n`

This doesn't mean that `σ n` is itself strictly increasing (what we call a `Subseq`). The sequence could jump around all over the place, as long as its graph stays above that of $y = x$.

But hopefully it's \"intuitively clear\" from `hσ` that `σ` eventually blows up, gets larger and larger over time, just not monotonically so. That is, there should be *some* way to \"accelerate\" `σ` so that it becomes a `Subseq`. The only problem is: how do you *actually* do this?

## The Key Idea: Orbits

The key idea is that of an **orbit**. In astronomy, you can imagine looking up at the sky night after night and trying to track the location of, say, Jupiter against the \"fixed\" stars (celestial sphere). You start your observations with Jupiter having some \"phase-space\" (position, velocity) $x_0$; let $T$ be the function that runs Newtonian dynamics for one day, so that $T(x_0)$ is the new phase-space of Jupiter tomorrow, moving as it does according to Newton's laws and gravity. Then $T(T(x_0))$ is the phase space after two days, and so on. The whole **orbit** of Jupiter over time is then the sequence:
$$x_0, T(x_0), T(T(x_0)), T(T(T(x_0))), \\ldots$$

More generally, if you have any function $f : X \\to X$ that takes an abstract space $X$ to itself, and you start with some base point $x_0 : X$, then we write $f^{[n]}(x_0)$ for $f$ iterated $n$ times applied to $x_0$. The sequence $n \\mapsto f^{[n]}(x_0)$ is called the \"orbit of $x_0$ under the action of $f$\".

## Application to Our Problem

How does that help us here? We could start with any base point `n₀ : ℕ`, and we know from `hσ` specialized to `n = n₀` that `n₀ < σ n₀`, but we have no idea how big `σ n₀` is; it could be huge. So how do we ensure that the next term exceeds `σ n₀`?

(Want to think about it for a minute before reading on?)

Given our previous discussion, hopefully you see right away that: if we were to specialize `hσ` to `n = σ n₀`, we would get: `σ n₀ < σ (σ n₀)`. So now it's clear: the way to get larger and larger terms from the sequence `σ` is to take the orbit!

**Your goal in this level:** Prove that for any fixed `n₀`, the orbit `n ↦ σ^[n] n₀` is a `Subseq`.

## New Tools

### Function Iteration: `succ_iterate`

While `σ^[k] (σ n) = σ^[k+1] (n)` is true by definition, it takes an argument by induction to show that if instead of adding a `σ` on the right, we add it on the left:

`σ (σ^[k] n) = σ^[k+1] n`

We'll spare you that proof and give you the theorem `succ_iterate`.

### Subsequence from Successor: `subseq_of_succ`

To prove that `σ` is a `Subseq`, the definition speaks of all `i < j`, but it's enough to do it one step at a time. The theorem `subseq_of_succ` says that it's enough to show that `σ n < σ (n+1)` holds for all `n` to conclude `Subseq σ`. You can `apply` this fact to reduce showing `Subseq σ` to just showing that `σ` increases from `n` to `n+1`.

### Tactic: `show`

Syntax: `show fact by proof`. For example, if you want to rewrite by the fact that `σ (σ^[n] n₀) = σ^[n+1] n₀` without a separate `have` declaration, you can write:

`rewrite [show σ (σ^[n] n₀) = σ^[n+1] n₀ by apply succ_iterate]`

Conclusion "
## What You've Accomplished

You've just proven a fundamental result about extracting monotonic behavior from non-monotonic sequences. By taking the orbit of any sequence that grows faster than the identity, you've shown that iteration naturally produces strictly increasing subsequences.

## The Key Insight

The power of this result lies in the orbit construction: even though `σ` might jump around chaotically, as long as it always moves forward (`n < σ n`), iterating it from any starting point creates a predictable, monotonic pattern. This is the mathematical analogue of how planetary orbits reveal underlying order in seemingly complex celestial mechanics.

## Looking Ahead

This technique will be crucial in future levels. The ability to extract monotonic subsequences from sequences with persistent gaps will allow us to construct a contradiction with boundedness - showing that such gaps must eventually disappear.

The orbit method you've mastered here demonstrates a powerful principle: iteration can transform local properties (like `n < σ n`) into global structure (like strict monotonicity). This pattern appears throughout analysis, where local behavior accumulates into global phenomena.
